			<h2>
				What is code?
			</h2>
			
				<p>
					In computer programming, computer code refers to the set of instructions, or a system of rules, written in a particular programming 
					<br> 
					language. It is also the term used for the source code after it has been processed by a compiler and made ready to run on the computer. 
					<br> 
					For example, the object code. In addition to building computer programs and mobile applications, code is used heavily for innovative 
					<br> 
					concepts such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Code can be used in a lot of things including websites, video games, and 
					<br> 
					even pictures. 
					<br> 
					<br> 
					For video games, Most games are written with custom code based on the programming language. A 3D code engine is used to generate 
					<br> 
					the code necessary for all of the polygons, shadows and other textures the user sees on the screen. Another important aspect of the code 
					<br> 
					is the artificial intelligence component which is also coded on it's own. Generally for making games, you would most likely use a 
					<br> 
					coding language called C++. 
					<br> 
					<br> 
					Usually Coders use HTML to determine where elements are placed on a web page. If you wanted to make it yourself. you'll need to 
					<br> 
					learn the language to build a website. Thankfully, HTML is a very simple and easy to learn language. HTML is also, “the most basic 
					<br> 
					building block of the Web.” According to Mozilla. The hypertext of HTML refers to the links that connect pages. 
					<br> 
					<br> 
					Images are created by Subband image coding (subband meaning, "a subdivision of a band"), which is based on the decomposition of the 
					<br> 
					input image into relatively narrow subbands where each of these subbands is then decimated and encoded with a coder and bit rate 
					<br> 
					accurately matched to the statistics of that particular subband. Usually for making images, C/C++ would be used.

				<h2>
					Different coding languages. 
				</h2>
				
				<p>
					There are so many different coding languages out there that it's hard to keep track of all of them, in this section you will learn all about the 
					<br> 
					different types of coding languages, where/how you should use them and why? As I said before, all of the different languages are used to 
					<br> 
					do different things, some of them make games, pictures, websites, etc. But you may be asking yourself which ones are the best to use for 
					<br> 
					which context and why. Well the simple answer is that the different languages were all made with different functions and were all made to 
					<br> 
					be able to do a set number of tasks. 
					<br> 
					<br> 
					First of all, what are all of the different languages and how many are there? Today there have been reports of over 250-2,500 different 
					<br> 
					coding languages so we obviously won't go through them all, however we will cover some of the most commonly known languages across 
					<br> 
					the world.
					<br>
					<br>
					Javascript.
					<br>
					Javascript, is a coding/programmming language. According to techopedia, "Javascript is primarily used on the Web." It is used to 
					<br> 
					enhance HTML pages and is mostly seen inside HTML code. JavaScript is an interpreted language. That means it does not need to be
					<br>
					compiled to be able to run commands.
					<br>
					<br>
					Python.
					<br>
					Python is an all purpose simple programming language mostly used to help make websites, data analytics and automation. Python is a 
					<br> 
					versatile language which means it can be used to program pretty much anything.
					<br>
					<br>
					HTML.
					<br>
					HTML is probably the simplest of them all, HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the basic language for creating 
					<br> 
					Websites/Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. It's one of the easiest to learn and it's very simple to use when you 
					<br> 
					have it down.
