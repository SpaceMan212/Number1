		<h2>
			Different coding languages (continued).
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			C++.
			<br>
			According to W3Schools.com, “C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a 
			<br> 
			clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.” 
			<br> 
			C++  can be used to develop apps that can be changed to work with various platforms. C++ 
			<br> 
			is a very good choice for game development aswell as large scale websites.

		<h2>
			Why is code important?
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			according to bestCollges.com, "Coding creates a set of instructions for computers to follow. These 
			<br> 
			instructions determine what actions a computer can and cannot take. Coding allows programmers to 
			<br> 
			build programs, such as websites and apps." Code is important because if it were never made, we 
			<br> 
			wouldn't have things like computers or phones today. It's most important for computers because if 
			<br> 
			you didn't have code but you tried to run a computer, the motherboard isn't able to send commands 
			<br> 
			for the computer to run which means you're doing nothing.

		<h2>
			The basics of python.
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			Python is a coding language similar to english, it has a certain syntax in it which allows it to need 
			<br>
			less lines of code than a regualar coding language. Python works on an interpreter system which means 
			<br> 
			it's able to run as soon as it's written. This allows prototyping to be done very quickly. The easiest 
			<br> 
			thing to make in python is a simple choose your own adventure game which uses some of the simplest 
			<br> lines of code ever.
