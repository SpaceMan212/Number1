						you may have heard about a thing called code and are interested but don't know where to get started, luckily, this is the option perfect for you. Troughout 
						<br> 
						this beginners guide you will see the basics of code, what it does, why it exists, and why it is important. 
						I will also teach you some simple things you can 
						<br> 
						code in python, one of the most common coding languages out there. 
						<br> 
						<br> 
						As you will see soon enough, coding is very important as we continue to go further 
						<br> 
						with technology. I 
						personally think everyone should have a basic understanding of computer science/technology for that reason. That leads me to my next 
						<br> 
						point, on this website the main goal is to teach you the basic understanding of code, Which will be covered in P1, "what is code?" I 
						have made this 
						<br> 
						website to be as informative as possible, to help you learn, and while also being fun. Have fun learning!
